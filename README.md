# SKILINE

I am an avid skier, and I've always been frustrated by how complicated ski weather apps can be. I built this application as a resource for the relevant information I need to make a decision about which mountain to visit on the weekends.

The UI is built with React and fetches three day weather forecasts from weatherapi.com.
